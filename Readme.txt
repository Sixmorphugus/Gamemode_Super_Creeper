Super Creeper
A gamemode, based on the original "brick cancer" biomass scripts by Mr. Wallet

// READ THIS //
Congratulations on your download of the new creeper mod. Here is everything you need to know about how it works, what it does, and how to map for it. The fact that you're reading my code shows that you want to know how to mod or map for the gamemode, because Blockland is one of those games with one of those communities that doesn't know what documentation is.

GAMEMODE LIST // (This is also in official Map config.cs files)

- 0 = Man Vs Creeper (Erradicate the creeper without dying. Players will use their own /shop CreepKill weapons.)
- 1 = Creepageddon (Survive together until the timer runs out or one person is left - requires a big map to be fun)
- 2 = Rising Creeper (Creepageddon with Push Brooms! Players will be allowed other competitive weapons via /shop)
- 3 = Erradication (Man Vs Creeper but respawning is allowed - creeper wins if not eraddicated after time limit)
- 4 = Karoshi (Everyone gets Creeper Planter, the objective is to cover enough map as quickly as possible. It won't kill)
- 5 = Outbreak (Erradication but this time the creeper needs to spread a certain distance. Time limit causes a player win.)
- 6 = That Bastard (Someone invisible gets a Creeper Planter and Creep Immunity. He has to kill everyone without being shot.)

only gamemodes 0, 1 and 3 work right now. Do not try to use any others until they are coded in.

// MAPPING //
If you're making a Man Vs Creeper map:
- Try to keep it small and enclosed. Creeper can climb the walls and the ceiling. Do not use doors, especially the new ones - they can break things. Try to put the players in a position where they can fight or die.

If you're making a Creepageddon or Rising Creeper map:
- Try to have a similar structure to Rising Lava maps. I know it sounds cliche, but you'll need a lot of high spots for a good game. Also, make sure the creeper does not start anywhere near the top. Make it nice and large, but still enclosed.

If you're making an Erradication map:
- Have a a build with lots of open space and lots of walls. ACM City may be appropriate, or perhaps Afganistan if you want an idea of how to do it. (Or just package one of those, I'm going to)

In general:
- If all the creeper is cleared in Creepageddon, the players all win, just like Man Vs Creeper. You can make Creepageddon maps with a "win" button that does this at the end, if you want.
- Make sure to tweak the creeper settings properly in your map's config.cs. You don't want a tiny map with lighting creeper or a huge map with creeper that's too slow to hurt anyone. Anticipate your ideal playercount. You won't be too far off.
- Although keeping Man Vs Creeper maps small is always a good idea, please remember to give your players space to move.
- Place your Creeper Spawns in positions where players cannot control them from the start. Your rounds won't last very long if you forget to do this.
- Have fun mapping.


// MODDING //
Still here? Dang. I thought I'd gotten rid of you.
Since I have no idea what you want to do with your "mod of a mod", I'll just give you some functions and let you get on.

StartCreeper() - Starts the creeper spreading.
StopCreeper() - Stops the creeper from spreading. Can restart with StartCreeper() in theory, I've not actually tried.
ClearCreeper() - Clears creeper bricks and puts spawn bricks back where they were.

Also:
- If you want to add a gamemode: You're out of luck, this isn't a fancy system like Slayer and TDM. Crowbar it in. You can do it. Be a man.
- DO NOT mess with $Creep::Active. I have and it does not do what you think it does.
- I have absolotely no idea how creeper generation works. Wallet didn't annotate his code, and he ain't around to ask.
- The Map Cycling in this mod is based off the map cycling in Speedkart, Zapk's rising lava and Zapk's Prop Hunt.
- Refrain from releasing "mods of my mod". I know this is a "mod of a mod" itself but the mod it's a mod of has been broke for a long time. Also, if you release a "mod of my mod" your mod will be a "mod of a mod of a mod".
